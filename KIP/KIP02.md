Adopt a Code of Conduct

# Authors

# Summary
* Adopt a standard code of conduct template across the entire project.
* Encourage moderators to organise their own governance independent of project leadership.

# Motivation
In order to nurture its growing community, and to make it easier to moderate in a fair and predictable manner, Yearn should adopt a project-wide code of conduct.

Instead of reinventing the wheel, adopt a standard that is already used by large open sources projects such as Golang, Linux, React, Vue.js, and many more.

If this proposal passes, Kropotkin will adopt the latest version of the Contributor Covenant for all contributors to Kropotkin related repositories, forums, chats, communities, and events. Moderators across the project will work to uphold its standards and carry out enforcement actions as specified in it.

See the related FAQ for answer to common questions about the Contributor Covenant.

Moderators should begin to self-organize and discuss enforcement processes.
