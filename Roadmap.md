# Milestones

## Launching the KUDU token
We will develop the KUDU token with a fixed supply and launch it on the Fuji testnet. After doing some initial testing, we will then launch the token on the Avalanche mainnet. Initial holder will be the Kudoo company, although this will be temporary until we can complete the fair launch of all tokens and hand over on chain governance to the community. Please see [Tokenomics](Tokenomics.md) for more details on the Token distribution.

After the mainnet launch we will also list on Pangolin and provide rewards for Liquidity Providers. This will also be when we launch a few marketing initiatives
* Upgraded website
* Telegram channel
* Discord channel
* List on ICOdrops.com 


## Web application
The first phase of building the application is to conduct User research. The user research will occur for existing projects operating in DeFi, most notably projects using Snapshot.

Since most of the governance of these protocols are occurring on Snapshot and driven by the developers the best place to engage with these users are through their projects Discord channels.

Our research will consist initially of questionnaires and online sessions in exchange for distribution of our native token `KUDU`. 

After we have compiled the research we will start work on the UX low fidelity prototype.

Once the low fidelity prototype has been designed we will use [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) for the prototype, which we will then submit to a small beta testing group. This group will be rewarded with `KUDU` coins to participate. Once we've compiled the feedback we will continue into designing the high fidelity prototype.

This release will leverage our existing set of [components](https://github.com/kudoo-cloud/shared-components)

At this stage we will develop the application. All development will occur on Github under a `MIT` license and anyone contributing code will receive `KUDU` coins.

While the application is being built, we will open up our manual governance structure, so that people can already start proposing Kropotkin Improvement Proposals in preparation for the handover of the project to the community.

Infrastructure to host the project will be sourced and once the development of the project is live, the first major project to use Kropotkin will be Kropotkin itself. The first votes will cover
* Distribution schedule of remaining 80% of token supply
* Allocation of Tokens
