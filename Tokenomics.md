There will be a token `PAK` issued as part of the Project. 

Some of the reasoning behind the token usage are:
- [ ] Prevent bad actors within the ecosystem
- [ ] Governance of the Kropotkin project
- [ ] Encourage adoption of the project
- [ ] Support the ongoing development of the project

The token will adopt a fair launch. No founder or investor allocation. 

Fixed Supply cap of 1 million tokens

# Distribution schedule
In the first year we'll distribute 200,000 `PAK` tokens.
## First year
We'll distribute 
* 50 000 to early adopters at $0.01 a token
* 100 000 to developers
* 50 000 to Liquidity providers on Pangolin

After the first year all future distribution will be down to the community. This will be voted on via Quadratic voting on Kropotkin under the [KIP01](KIP/KIP01.md) proposal.
