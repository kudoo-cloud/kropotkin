So we'll have a token. The main reason for the token usage is:
- [ ] Prevent Cybersquatting of the Governance of tokens
- [ ] Governance of the Mutual Aid project
- [ ] Support the ongoing development of the project

It'll be a completely fair launch. No founder or investor allocation.

Fixed Supply cap of 1 million tokens
