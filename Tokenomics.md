There will be a token `KUDU` issued as part of the Project. 

Some of the reasoning behind the token usage are:
- [ ] Prevent bad actors within the ecosystem by potentially charging projects to use Kropotkin 
- [ ] Enable advanced voting patterns such as quadratic voting
- [ ] Governance of the Kropotkin project
- [ ] Encourage adoption of the project
- [ ] Support the ongoing development of the project

The token will adopt a fair launch. No founder or investor allocation. 

Fixed Supply cap of 1 million tokens

# Distribution schedule
In the first year we'll distribute 200,000 `KUDU` tokens.

They'll be distributed as follows: 
* 50 000 to DeFi developers that contribute to User research
* 100 000 to developers who contribute to developing the application
* 50 000 to Liquidity providers on Pangolin

After the first year all future distribution will be down to the community. The vote will occur on Kropotkin.
