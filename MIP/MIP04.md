Adopt a Code of Conduct #QmbJd5r
Closed
Summary:

Adopt a standard code of conduct template across the entire project.
Encourage moderators to organise their own governance independent of project leadership.
Abstract:

In order to nurture its growing community, and to make it easier to moderate in a fair and predictable manner, Yearn should adopt a project-wide code of conduct.

Instead of reinventing the wheel, adopt a standard that is already used by large open sources projects such as Golang, Linux, React, Vue.js, and many more.

If this proposal passes, Yearn will adopt the latest version of the Contributor Covenant for all contributors to Yearn related repositories, forums, chats, communities, and events. Moderators across the project will work to uphold its standards and carry out enforcement actions as specified in it.

See the related FAQ for answer to common questions about the Contributor Covenant.

Moderators should begin to self-organize and discuss enforcement processes.

Motivation:

Without a code of conduct, it is unclear what kind of language and behaviour is tolerated in Yearn's community.

It makes enforcement arbitrary and subjective, complicating fair and appropriate moderation.

Having a code of conduct makes it clear for community members what is acceptable behaviour, and what to expect when there are violations.

Having a code of conduct as a "constitution", enables moderators to become autonomous and independent from the project's leadership team, as they can enforce its spirit without their involvement. This leads to less involvement of project leaders in moderation decisions, which leads to fewer accusations of abuse of power, censorship, or bias.

Specification:

Verbatim adoption of the Contributor Covenant.
Host on the yearn.finance website, with links to it from all relevant repositories in CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files.
Gather moderators together and work on enforcement, communication channels, and processes.
Aim to create a separate moderation team that is independent of project leadership.
